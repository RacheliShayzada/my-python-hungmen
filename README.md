# 🎮 Hangman Game in Python

Welcome to my little Hangman game – a fun project I built while learning Python in my CampusIL course! 🎓🐍  
The goal: guess the hidden word before our little stickman runs out of luck 😬

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a word
- In each turn, you can guess a single letter
- If the letter exists – great! If not – the stickman gets a new body part
- If you guess the whole word – you win! 🎉  
- If the hangman is complete – you lose!

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.6+)
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run the game with:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🛠 Main Files

- `main.py` – the core game logic
- `wordlist.txt` – list of possible words (optional)
- `README.md` – you're reading it now :)

---

## 🌟 Why I Made This

- Because I love learning by doing
- Because games are fun
- And because everyone should hang a stickman at least once in their code 😇
